--What are three of the primary responsibilities of a UIView object?
The primary responsibilities of the UIView object are:
  -Drawing and animation of content
  -Layout and subview management
  -Event handling, such as for touches and other gestures.
--What does documentation call a view that's embedded in another view?
  "View Hierarchies" These create parent-child relationships with the nested child view and its parent view
--What does documentation call the parent view that's embedding the other view?
  The "Superview"
--What is a view's frame?
  The frame is a property that defines the origin and dimensions of it's view based in the coordinate system of its parent view.
--How is a view's bounds different from its frame?
  The bounds on the other hand, define the internal dimensions of their view. There is also another property called center that allows a view to be repositioned without having to modify it's frame or bounds properties.
